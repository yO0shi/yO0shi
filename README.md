## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a meaningful website for some people
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Javascript, and React
- I'm currently reached 233 days streak challenge on Mimo!
- I'm currently working on Swift too.　So  far, it looks very similar to Grammar of Javascript!(No, it's different. When creating function, the syntax is different. Need to get used to it.)
- everytime I learn return of function section, I realize that I don't understand what return is for. For app creation, it is necessary to learn Swift code!!
- I still can't believe that I learned coding for 100days straight. Even if it's a small section, it stii has pushed me forward. Proud of myself.
- I completed Swift course on Mimo!!
- I am currently working on SQL!!! It is like a logic thing.
  
- Codes that I'm actively working on:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Swift
  - React
  - Javascript
  - Python
  - SQL(kinda logic game)
  - Typescript(kinda js thing?)
