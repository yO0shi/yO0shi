## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a meaningful website for some people
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Javascript, and React
- I'm currently reached 134 days streak challenge on Mimo!
- I'm currently working on Swift too.ã€€So  far, it looks very similar to Grammar of Javascript!(No, it's different. When creating function, the syntax is different. Need to get used to it.)
- everytime I learn return of function section, I realize that I don't understand what return is for. For app creation, it is necessary to learn Swift code!!
- I still can't believe that I learned coding for 100days straight. Even if it's a small section, it stii has pushed me forward. Proud of myself.
- I completed Swift course on Mimo!!
- I am currently working on SQL!!!
  
- Codes that I'm actively working on:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Swift
  - React
  - Javascript
  - Python
